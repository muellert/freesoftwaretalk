Change in Business Models
=========================

Classic Proprietary Situation:
------------------------------

Revenue relies on

 * license fees
 * service subscriptions
 * consulting and customization


Classic Free Software Situation:
--------------------------------

Revenue relies on

 * service subscriptions
 * consulting and customization


Comparison of Revenue Streams
-----------------------------

It has to be noted, though, that the consulting and customization part
of the revenue typically consumes a larger proportion of a (client's)
project's budget - first, due to technical reasons, since the license
fee part does frequently not exist, secondly, because the client can
spend each RMB only once, and third, because there is much more
opportunity for such kind of change. So the client can opt for having
the software better adapted to his needs, instead of adapting himself
to the software.
