The Software Crisis Days
========================

 * The industry was scrambling to meet customer demands for software,
   due to lack of software engineers.

 * Since customer demands soared faster than industry output, to many
   this looked like an uphill battle.

 * At this stage, standard software was not widely available, everyone was
   cooking their own.

 * Intellectual Property Rights ("IP" for short) were massively
   tightened, and the software industry saw the introduction of
   patents into their field, exacerbating the problem of the lack of
   software.

 * At the same time, developers were getting more and more aggravated
   about the restrictions they had to work under, and the industry had
   little choice than to use what was available to meet customer
   demand (dreams of computers programming computers were beginning to
   wane).
