Competing With Proprietary
==========================

Free Software provides both competitive pressure and also relief to
vendors and users of proprietary software.


The Pressure
------------

The Free Software Ecosystem puts, in some areas, a lot of pressure on
vendors of proprietary systems:

 * Pressure to provide documentation mounts, again (finally!), as
   demand for multi-platform support, both in terms of hardware and
   operating systems, goes up.

 * The added-value proposition of proprietary vendors begins to
   slide, or erodes entirely (examples: BitKeeper vs. GIT, or DocX
   vs. ODT).

 * Aggregate development teams in Free Software can surpass any team a
   single vendor can hire, sometimes making it increasingly difficult
   for any vendor to compete with a given Free Software project
   (examples: The Linux kernel, or OpenStack).

 * Buerocratic friction within a vendor's department may potentially
   increase the effect.

 * Employees generally like the team spirit in Free Software projects
   better than strict control, and may eg. ask vendors for less
   restrictive work environments.

 * In case Free Software is established as a standard plattform,
   eg. Linux or OpenStack, ISVs can work against such a plattform and
   remain independent of other companies, as they can more easily
   ignore their rapid change of mind (see eg. "Silverlight").

 * Free Software has generally empowered users (its original purpose),
   and led to different expectations on the buyer side,
   accordingly. Buyers now tend to want stronger indication that an
   offering actually provides value to them, and are more capable to
   understand the offering, to begin with.



The Relief
----------

Free Software also provides relief to the proprietary software sector:

 * Creating a large body of "standard software", like eg. the Linux
   kernel, reliefs the industry from having to reinvent the wheel in
   every single enterprise, and also reduces product cost by large
   amounts.

 * Thus, the software crisis is being defused a little, and vendors
   can concentrate on real added value, instead of having to rely on
   half-baked software pieces that are now being provided as
   commodities.

 * Users have been known to use Free Software as a lever in
   negotiations to reduce licensing cost. This has only become
   possible after important functionality has become available in Free
   Software, so users can no longer be held ransom indefinitely.
