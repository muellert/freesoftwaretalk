Free Software and Standards
===========================

The Free Software Movement has created a lot of common ground, which
has proven to be so effective, that vendors are incorporating these
developments into their tools.

Examples are increasing support for `git` in commercial SCM tools,
widespread adoption of PHP, or simply vendors basing their products on
Linux instead of eg. WinCE (car dashboards, POS systems, etc.).


Data Formats
------------

 * Free Software introduced a licensing requirement to use standards,
   namely, that they be available free of cost. [#]_ Therefore,
   vendors who want their standards also be accepted by the Free
   Software community, have to consider including an appropriate
   licensing model.

 * At least one important standard was created to meet these
   requirements of Free Software ("ODT").

 * At least one standard was licensed much cheaper than originally
   intended, due to the competitive position with regards to a freely
   available, but competing, standard (MPEG4 vs. WebM [#]_ ).

 * Such standards play a very important role in Free Software, because
   vendor lock-in is generally at least frowned upon, and usually
   leads to users abandoning the software.

 * But the huge threat looming on the horizon would be ubiquitious
   acknowledgement of software patents.


Development Standards And The Toolchain
---------------------------------------

Free Software has also given rise to a large number of "industry
standards" in the area of development practices and toolchain
development.

   * Developers tend prefer all sorts of languages that are freely
     available, and tend to avoid those which are prominent in
     corporate settings. Example: Gnu-CC vs. SUN-CC.

   * Powerful tools have been developed to support collaborative
     development across all countries, languages and cultures,
     complementing the shared codebase with a shared set of best
     practices. Free Software has made I18N and L10N awareness a
     standard feature of software.

     Before, every vendor was brewing their own, if anything. Now
     there are tools like Rosetta, and big vendors follow suit to
     provide localized versions of their software, too.

   * The  major  tools  in  Systems  Administration,  like  (formerly)
     CfEngine, now Puppet, also originated in the Free Software world,
     outcompeting the likes of Tivoli and CA Unicenter, while also
     offering multi-platform support.


.. [#] This follows transitively from the free software definition,
       because using non-free standards would violate the freedom
       of free redistribution as a side-effect.
