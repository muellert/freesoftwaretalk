Development of the Original Problem Case
========================================

 * First Phase of IT: Hardware was sold, software did not really
   exist, and/or was supplied in the same style as a manual or power
   chord.

   * Software was supplied in source-only form.

 * Second Phase: Vendors started to try making software into an extra
   product, placing increasingly annoying restrictions on software.

   * They asked extra money for software.
   * They started to omit source code.
   * They put license restrictions in place to increase their
     revenue.

 * Third Phase: Programmers were getting more and ore frustrated,
   especially those, who remembered the early days, when software was
   shared freely.

   * Richard Stallman in particular got so much annoyed, that he
     devised the GNU General Public License, essentially hacking the
     copyright law in an attempt to ensure that software thus licensed
     will be freely available forever.

   * People increasingly tried to evade harsh company rules and
     flocked to the FSF or similar organisations, which sprang
     into existance (eg. OSI).

   * The term "Free Software"[#]_ was coined.
