Company Size and Free Software
==============================

With Free Software, the cost of market entry are, in tendency, much
lower than with proprietary software. Not only can the (budding)
vendor more easily choose their own innovation cycle, they also
overwhelmingly do not have to go through any registration and approval
process, or leak their development ideas to anyone, since there is no
automatic feedback from the developer/vendor-in-the-making to the
upstream tool provider. [#]_

This works as an impediment to the general concentration movement in
the industry and helps to preserve the independence of many small
enterprises.


.. [#] Refer to typical developer programs, where you have to buy
       certain gear, or are required to ship something until a certain
       date, or to disclose your ideas to the tool provider.
