Receiving Competition From Proprietary
======================================

Free Software has long been under pressure. The following is a summary
of the current threat situation, as I preceive it:

Individual Enterprise Scale
---------------------------

 * Free Software has frequently been slandered as being an unusable
   mess created by uneducated kids.

   This problem is slowly going away, as more and more big-name
   companies jump onto the bandwaggon and provide products and
   services around Free Software.

 * Vendors try to hijack Free Software projects, eg. by purchasing the
   primary developer (CUPS, anyone?), then starving the free version
   of the software. See also Oracle and MySQL - what, if Monty was hit
   by a bus?

 * Vendors have been known to contest Free Software licenses in court,
   so as to invalidate their copyright claims and positing Free
   Software as generally in the public domain, thus prey to anyone who
   comes to take it. See http://gplviolations.org for an indication

Global Scale
------------

On a larger scale, repeated  attempts are being made to effectively
outlaw Free Software.

   These legal obstacles come in several forms:

   * Software patents: No software can withstand a massive patent
     attack, and almost no vendor can possibly defend against it. Free
     Software is more vulnerable, because patent violation would be
     more easily detected, and funds to pay license fees, or even
     damages, do not exist. Overmore, small and independent developers
     may be deterred to continue their projects to avoid the legal
     risk.

   * Copyright law, especially in forms mandating DRM, will restrict
     the ability to run Free Software (see TPM and UEFI, or now the
     most recent Web Standards track to enable DRM in HTML5), as Free
     Software will be unable to comply with any such restrictions.

     This problem is exacerbated by international pressure coming down
     via the WTO (-> WIPO -> TRIPS) paths, which is extremely hard
     to resist.

   * Big vendors may coerce manufacturers to produce only hardware, on
     which Free Software cannot run.
